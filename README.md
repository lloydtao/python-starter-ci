# Python Starter CI

A Python project template with GitHub Actions pipelines included.

## Introduction

This starter kit includes a GitHub Actions workflow to lint and test the project within pull requests.

This is an application of [Continuous Integration](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration) (CI).

It's that simple!

GitHub Actions implements the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principle, and picks up anything from `.github/workflows/*.yml`.
